If you want to make your own data project you can do `sanity install`, I think. Or you can connect it to a project (https://manage.sanity.io/). And put your projectId in the _api.projectId_ part of _sanity.json_.

Also you can import my dataset to your solution with  
`> sanity dataset import all.tar.gz dev`
